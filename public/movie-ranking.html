<h1>My Best K-Drama of All Time</h1>
    <h2>Ranked by Buzor_ated</h2>

<hr/>

        <h3>Coffee Prince</h3>
            <p>Superb, unforgettbable. Ironically the plot was not quite realistic however, 
    the acting and "feels" definitely was.</p>

        <h3>Scralet Heart</h3>    
            <p>Been a while I watched this but the name stuck to memory, 
    so must have been a good watch.</p>

        <h3>Mr. Plankton</h3>
            <p>Discovered this one in 2024. 
    Definitely had me glued to the screen for a bit. Great acting. 
    You get a good laugh too!</p>
